### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

<br>

The main way I write programs in this manner is to first write code that is easy to read.  Try to follow the same coding coventions throughout the entire program. Write small classes and functions and making sure to use meaningful names. with the project dashboard, each operation was set within their own method or function.  The main advantage to this is that the codes was easier to devlop by being able to isolate each CRUD operation and check its functionality. This python module can easily be adapted to many different types of dashboard setups.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

<br>
The most efficient way to approach a problem as a computer scientist is to take the more complicated tasks and break them down to many simpler tasks that all work up to completing the complicated tasks. With this assignment, I have never worked with dash and had very little experience with python.  To overcome these challenges was to first test that the python code successfully interacts with the mongo database to complete CRUD operations.  Once that was confirmed, the next step was to learn how dash works by creating smaller code to verify dash operations.  After this step was confirmed, then it was time to integrate the more complicated functions to complete a working dashboard. The main differnce between my previous techniques and the techniques here was to create smaller outputs using known working code with dash mainly because when dash does have a failure, it just doesnt generate, but there were no error codes.  With working with small batches of code with bash, when a point didnt generate, then I knew the problem was at that point and not before.  This technique also stops me from going too far in the code before finding a problem, as well as easily locating integration problems like implementing a new function that now causes an issue.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

<br>

Overall, a computer scientists use technology to solve problems.  In this case the tasks is to create software applications that help with interactions between people and software or devices. The project for Grazioso Salvare will help them be able to complete remdial tasks like maintaining a database more efficient.  With this gained efficiency, they be enhance their efforts, grown their business, or broaden their reach to help more animals.
